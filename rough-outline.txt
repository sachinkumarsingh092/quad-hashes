OUTPUT OF QUAD CALCULATION (8 columns).
MULTI-THREADED

Steps:
 1) NO HEALPIX(!) Just grid the range of RA/DEC in relative box sizes (5x5).
 2) 5 brightest stars in each healpix (10 healpixes = 50 stars (max) = 50 quads (max))
 -----muti-threaded-----
 3) for each star, look in a circle the radius of the healpix.
 3.1) find N, N-2, N-4 most distant stars within that circle.
      Also account for big difference in brightness (larger than error).
 3.2) Calculate the quad hashes for that star.

 Brightness component:    (position of star A in sorted quad stars)      3
                          (position of star B in sorted quad stars)      2
			  (position of star C in sorted quad stars)      0  (brightest: lowest numerical magnitude value)
			  (position of star D in sorted quad stars)      1  (next brightest)
    Through a 4*4 bit unsigned integer and bit-shifting.

=======================================
Matching with inidividual catalogs
=======================================

1) Load the necessary tables:
    1) Reference catalog (RA, Dec, Mag)
    2) kd-tree and quad tables (11 columns)
    3) Catalog to-match (X, Y, Mag).

2) Find all quads in to-match catalog.
   Divide the full X,Y range in each dimension into N boxs (maybe 5x5).

3) Find all the quads and a match with the kd-tree (in parallel).

4) Now we know the (X,Y) ---> (RA,Dec) for random points in input catalog.
   4.1) Fit a distortional model onto this tranformation.
   4.2) And this will give us the WCS!
