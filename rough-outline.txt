OUTPUT OF QUAD CALCULATION (8 columns).
MULTI-THREADED

Steps:
 1) find healpixs
 2) 5 brightest stars in each healpix (10 healpixes = 50 stars (max) = 50 quads (max))
 -----muti-threaded-----
 3) for each star, look in a circle the radius of the healpix.
 3.1) find N, N-2, N-4 most distant stars within that circle.
      Also account for big difference in brightness (larger than error).
 3.2) Calculate the quad hashes for that star.

 Brightness component:    (position of star A in sorted quad stars)      3
                          (position of star B in sorted quad stars)      2
			  (position of star C in sorted quad stars)      0  (brightest: lowest numerical magnitude value)
			  (position of star D in sorted quad stars)      1  (next brightest)
    Through a 4*4 bit unsigned integer and bit-shifting.
